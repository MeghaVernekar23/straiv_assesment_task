# Automated Testing Framework

## Overview

This README provides insights into the selection of the testing framework cypress for our usecase, and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of using **Cypress** over **Playwright**.

## Tool Comparison: Cypress vs. Playwright

### Cypress

#### **Advantages**

1. **Ease of Setup and Use**: Cypress offers a highly intuitive setup with minimal configuration. It is perfect for teams wanting to get started quickly.
2. **Real-Time Test Runner**: Cypress provides an interactive test runner with time travel debugging, letting you see step-by-step actions and easily debug.
3. **Automatic Waiting**: Built-in automatic waits for DOM elements to appear, reducing the need for manual wait commands.
4. **Focus on Frontend Testing**: Optimized for testing frontend applications with great support for frameworks like Vue, React, and Angular.
5. **Built-In Assertions**: Cypress provides built-in commands and assertions tailored for frontend testing, which reduces reliance on additional libraries.
6. **Extensive Documentation and Community**: Cypress has been around longer, providing more comprehensive resources and community-driven plugins.

#### **Disadvantages**

1. **Limited Browser Support**: Cypress mainly supports Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. It does not support Safari or WebKit out-of-the-box, limiting cross-browser testing.
2. **No Native Mobile Emulation**: Cypress does not offer native mobile browser testing or mobile device emulation.
3. **Limited Multi-Tab Support**: Cypress has some restrictions on handling multiple tabs or windows during testing.
4. **Not Ideal for Backend Testing**: While Cypress can make API requests, it is mainly designed for frontend, UI-centric tests.

### Playwright

#### **Advantages**

1. **Multi-Browser Support**: Playwright supports Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and WebKit, including testing on Safari and mobile browsers.
2. **Advanced Control**: Playwright provides granular control over browser contexts, making it ideal for more complex scenarios like handling multiple tabs, downloads, and network events.
3. **Mobile Emulation**: Native support for mobile device emulation and testing on real mobile browsers.
4. **Cross-Platform and Multi-Context**: Can run tests in parallel across different browser environments, making it suitable for more diverse test scenarios.

#### **Disadvantages**

1. **Steeper Learning Curve**: Playwright offers more flexibility but requires more configuration and setup compared to Cypress.
2. **No Interactive Test Runner**: Unlike Cypress, Playwright does not have a built-in interactive GUI for running and debugging tests in real-time.
3. **Manual Wait Handling**: Playwright requires more explicit wait commands in test scripts for certain actions, which can make tests more prone to timing issues.

## Why Cypress Was Chosen for This Project

Cypress was chosen for testing for several key reasons:

1. **Focus on Frontend Testing**: The primary goal of this project is to test the UI and user workflows (e.g., registration, login, purchasing), where Cypress excels. Its UI-centric design makes it an ideal fit for this type of testing.
2. **Ease of Setup and Debugging**: Cypress provides a quicker setup and more intuitive debugging experience with its real-time test runner. This is essential for rapid iterations and easier identification of issues, especially during the 5-day testing phase.

3. **Automatic Waiting**: Since the website has dynamic content and user interactions, Cypress’ automatic waiting features reduce the need to manage timeouts and manual waits, improving test reliability.

4. **Simplified Assertions and DOM Interaction**: Cypress’ built-in commands and assertions make it easy to write tests that interact with the DOM and verify UI states without requiring external libraries.

5. **Large Community and Ecosystem**: Cypress has extensive documentation, plugins, and a large community, making it easier to find support and resources for any testing-related questions or problems.

While **Playwright** is a powerful tool with broader browser support and advanced control features, the simplicity, ease of debugging, and frontend focus of **Cypress** made it the best fit for testing the user-centric features of the given exercise.
